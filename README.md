## The purpose of this repository is to learn git.
### It is free and open for all contributors
#### Just fork it, commit a change and make a pull request. I will add you as collaborator to allow the push access.
The idea is to create a few text files for anyone to edit.  
First one is country.txt  
Feel free to add more lines in this file to introduce yourself.  

Second is city.txt  
Use one line per developer.  

Add any other topic files for people to fill-in, edit, stage, commit and push.  
Favorite food, car, music, etc ?  
Just use the same convention for every file - use one line for one person.  
Create new files and learn how to use git.
